# Reducing-Commercial-Aviation-Fatalities
Most flight-related fatalities stem from a loss of “airplane state awareness.” That is, ineffective attention management on the part of pilots who may be distracted, sleepy or in other dangerous cognitive states.

our challenge is to build a model to detect troubling events from aircrew’s physiological data. we'll use data acquired from actual pilots in test situations, and our models should be able to run calculations in real time to monitor the cognitive states of pilots. With our help, pilots could then be alerted when they enter a troubling state, preventing accidents and saving lives.

Reducing aircraft fatalities is just one of the complex problems that Booz Allen Hamilton has been solving for business, government, and military leaders for over 100 years. Through devotion, candor, courage, and character, they produce original solutions where there are no roadmaps. Now we can help them find answers, save lives, and change the world.
